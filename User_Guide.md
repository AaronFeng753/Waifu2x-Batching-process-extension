- 5.GPU ID: This determines which GPU is used in Waifu2x-ncnn-vulkan mode. The default is to automatically select the GPU. You can also manually adjust which GPU is used for calculations by changing the GPU ID.

- 6.Save as .jpg?(Scale & Denoise): This determines whether to save the picture as a .jpg file after processing the picture. If set to 'n', it will be saved as .png. Saving as .jpg will cause a slight loss of picture quality, but will save a lot of space .

- 7.Optimize .gif?(Scale & Denoise): This decides whether to optimize the GIF after processing it, the image quality will be slightly lost after optimization, but it will save a lot of space.
